#Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data 
##Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Here are the data for the project:

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The run_analysis.R script

*1. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,
*2. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
*3. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
*4. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, and
*5. from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the transformations and work that is performed to clean up the data.
